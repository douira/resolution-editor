        | The interface provides hints and is usable on any device. You can generate a formatted document, add a clause or reorder with the push of a button. We'll do all the heavy lifting in the background and you just have to worry about what you want to say.

      +icon-box(icons.liveview, "Debate with LiveView")
        | Open a rendered and live updated version of your resolution on a different device for viewing it on a projector. Local devices connected to the projector can serve as output devices to reduce cable troubles. Changes are automatically color-coded in LiveView.

You're only required to enter an access code if editing access to the resolution has been #[b restricted] and you're granted elevated editing privileges with a personal access code. It's still possible to view a #[b read-only] version and metadata about a resolution if you don't have editing privileges. If you've forgotten your access code or have any other problems accessing the editor, please #[b contact IT-Management].
