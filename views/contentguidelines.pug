  p.justify These Content Guidelines serve to set a regulatory baseline concerning the use of the editor and what you're allowed to write in it. It's easily summarized:
  h5.light: blockquote.green-quote Use the Resolution Editor for what it's meant to be used for: #[b writing resolutions]. That alone sets the standard at a pretty high level. Like most laws try to incorporate, just use your #[b common sense].
  | Here are some things you should/shouldn't write in a resolution editor document:
  .row
    .col.m6.s12.green-text
      h5: b: u Good
      p Resolution content
      p Conform to the conference's rules for resolutions
      p Don't insert your own punctuation at the end of clauses; the Resolution Editor will insert these automatically and absolutely correctly!
      p Alert authorities about violating content or users
      p Help other users with the editor, tell them about these guidelines if they seem uninformed.
      p Read the Help page if you need an overview
    .col.m6.s12.red-text
      h5: b: u Not Good
      p Profanities, Insults
      p Inappropriate or offensive content or anything else nsfw
      p Bypassing of filters or restrictions
      p Off-topic content (Not resolution related)
      p Links to phishing sites or similar
      p Individual self-promotion (outside of political context)
      p Spam, Advertisement or Vandalistic content
      p Content that intentionally makes it hard to process in the resolution workflow
  p.center These guidelines may change with or without notice and are subject to interpretation by the administration.
